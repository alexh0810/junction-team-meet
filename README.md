# JUNCTION TEAM MEET 

## Project Overview

This is a 10 hours coding assignment provided by Junction. The job is to create a working prototype of Junction's meeting featured based on provided UI wireframe. 

### Features successfully built (within the course of 10 hours): 
### Front-end: 
- Team browsing: the user should be able to scroll through all the teams
- Show more button: Expand the team information card to see more information
- Apply button: Allowing the user to send application by pressing the 'apply' button on the team information card
- Application view: After pressing on the apply button, the user will be taken to an APPLY view where they will be able to type in their "motivation letter" in a text field and press SEND. 
### Back-end: 
- GET /api/v1/teams to get all teams 
- GET /api/v1/teams/:id to get one team
- POST /api/v1/teams/apply/:id to send application to a team
### Testing: 
- Simple render test for the APPLY view (frontend)
- Mock test for route POST /teams/apply/:id to successfully send an application
### Good to note (within the scope of this application): 
- The application assumes the workflow where authencation has been in placed 
### Features unfinished:
- Filter: the user should be able to filter the teams based on roles and challenge 
- Team review application view
### Further improvements: 
- User authentication: user should be able to sign up/ login, create a profile and add their CV. Team members can log in to review applications
- Currently, the expand event triggers all the cards at the same time, this needs to be fixed 
- The data returned for the application information does not contain the team information (needs to check the populate method from backend)
